# Cloud Deployer Lite 🚀

A minimal Python CLI for managing AWS EC2 instances — launch, list, and terminate — with a clean, extensible subcommand structure.  
Perfect as a starter DevOps automation tool or as a template for larger cloud management scripts.

---

## ✨ Features
- **`up`** — Launch a new EC2 instance (instance type configurable)
- **`list`** — Display all EC2 instances created by this tool
- **`down`** — Terminate an EC2 instance by ID

*(AWS integration coming soon — CLI structure is ready and functional with mock data.)*
